Atlascine is an online mapping platform for synthesizing and highlighting places and themes in stories and for navigating between them. As a fully open-source story mapping platform, Atlascine can serve as both a collaborative research tool as well as a publishing platform for exhibiting story collections. It works by facilitating the geographical and thematic annotation of video or audio transcripts, and seeks to help find connections between them through visualization and deep listening.
