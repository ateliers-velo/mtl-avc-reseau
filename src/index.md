Atlascine is an online mapping platform for annotating and navigating stories thematically and geographically. As a fully open-source story mapping platform, it can serve as both a collaborative research tool as well as a publishing platform for exhibiting story collections. It works by enabling places and themes to be tagged and mapped from video or audio transcripts, and to help users find connections between them through visualization and deep listening.
