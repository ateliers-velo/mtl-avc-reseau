A mapping platform that allows you to synthesize and highlight the places and themes that structure stories, as well as to enable navigation across collections of stories. As a fully open-source story mapping platform, Atlascine can serve as both a collaborative research tool as well as a publishing platform for exhibiting story collections and archives. It works through the annotation of transcripts of video or audio recordings. With Atlascine, maps are viewed not only as a means to visualize and locate stories, but also as a means to listen to them, to connect them, and navigate within and between them.
