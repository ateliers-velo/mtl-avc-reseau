As a fully open-source story mapping platform, Atlascine combines multimedia storytelling (video, audio and text) with digital mapping technologies to study and visualize spatial and thematic relationships. Atlascine can serve as both a collaborative research tool as well as a publishing platform for exhibiting your story collections and archives. The tool works by allowing users to annotate timestamped transcripts of video or audio recordings and then visualize these annotations across thematic, geographical and temporal dimensions.
