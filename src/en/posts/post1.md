title: 'launch of the Atlascine website'
---

Thanks to Emory Shaw, the new website dedicated to the Atlascine project has been officially launched! This website's goal is to provide a dedicated space for sharing information, news, content, ideas, and tips related to the Atlascine platform. Over the past few years, our main objective has been to collaborate with our partners from the Geomatics and Cartographic Research Center (GCRC) at Carleton University to completely redesign the previous version of the platform (you can learn more about the history of this project on the About page) and to support researchers interested in developing their own atlases using Atlascine (visit the Atlas page for examples). With this website, we are now ready to make this platform more accessible to anyone interested in visualizing stories that have already been mapped, showcasing some of these fascinating interviews, or creating their own maps and atlases.
