Lea Kabiljo, Professor at the School of Art at Laval University (Quebec) presented The "Raconte-moi Riopelle/Tell me about Riopelle" initiative at the 56th Annual Conference of the International Visual Literacy Association in San diego (USA).

The "Raconte-moi Riopelle/Tell me about Riopelle" initiative explores the life and legacy of Canadian artist Jean-Paul Riopelle through a series of raw, unedited oral history interviews with those who knew him. This approach emphasizes the significance of visual, non-verbal cues in these narratives, thereby enhancing archival practices by capturing nuances often missed in edited content. Central to this endeavor is Atlascine. By presenting unedited interviews and leveraging Atlascine, "Raconte-moi Riopelle" transforms traditional archival methods and democratizes the interpretation of Riopelleâ€™s life and art. This strategy challenges standard narrative constructs, allowing for a more inclusive and varied understanding of the artist and his legacy.
