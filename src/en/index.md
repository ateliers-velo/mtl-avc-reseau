Atlascine is a mapping platform for annotating transcribed, time-based media, and has already been used in oral history, film studies, urban studies and other qualitative social sciences and humanities research. The online tool allows audiovisual recordings such as interviews to be geographically and thematically visualized in chronological, interactive maps, enabling users to make connections between stories, places and themes through an innovative combination of visualization and deep listening.
