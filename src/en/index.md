Atlascine is an online mapping platform for annotating audiovisual stories and interviews. Once these stories are annotated, they are automatically transformed into interactive maps, enabling visualization, connection, and listening. With Atlascine, the map doesn't replace the stories; it accompanies, supports, illustrates, and unveils some of their mysteries. Most importantly, it invites us to take the time to listen to them.
