Atlascine is an online platform for annotating and mapping audio and video files. It allows any kinds of stories such as interviews to be geographically and thematically visualized with interactive maps. These automatically generated maps also offer innovative ways of navigating within and between these stories, listening to them and studying their spatial dimensions. This open-source online tool has already been used in oral history, film studies, urban studies and could be relevant for a range of social sciences and humanities research projects.
