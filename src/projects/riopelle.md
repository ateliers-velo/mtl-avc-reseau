### Tell Me About Riopelle

As a lead-up to the 100th anniversary of the birth of artist Jean Paul Riopelle in 2023, the Jean Paul Riopelle Foundation and Concordia University have teamed up for an ambitious project: to create a digital oral archive that will deepen our understanding of and share knowledge about the life and career of this world-renowned artist. This project, led by the Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling (COHDS), aims to collect stories that contribute to Riopelleâ€™s life story through the voices of those who knew him or encountered him, and to make these stories accessible across multiple channels.
