The Atlas of Rwandan Exiles is situated at the crossroads of two research projects: The Montreal Life Stories Project (2008-2012), an oral history project led by Steven High, during which hundreds of life stories of exiles and refugees living in Montreal were collected and archived at Concordia University by the Center for Oral History and Digital Storytelling (COHDS); and The Mapping (Life) Stories Project, a research project led by Sébastien Caquard dedicated to exploring the multiple methodological, technological, ethical and cartographic aspects of mapping stories, with a particular focus on life stories.
