There are three major ways of engaging with Atlascine as (1) an atlas user to learn about a particular story or topic; (2) a content creator to contribute to an existing map/atlas, and (3) atlas manager to set up and manage an entire atlas. 

The atlas user can be anyone interested in exploring, listening, analyzing and presenting the content of an existing atlas. For instance, individuals who might be interested in learning more about how Rwandan people experienced the 1994 genocide of the Tutsis of Rwanda or in using this atlas for educational purpose (e.g. to teach about this genocide).
