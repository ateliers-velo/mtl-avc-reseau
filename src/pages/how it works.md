There are three major ways of engaging with Atlascine: (1) as an atlas user to learn about a particular story or topic; (2) as a content creator to contribute to an existing map or atlas; (3) or as an atlas manager to set up and manage an entire Atlascine atlas.

## Atlas users

The **atlas user** can be anyone interested in exploring, listening, analyzing and presenting the content of an existing atlas. For instance, individuals who might be interested in learning more about how Rwandan people experienced the 1994 genocide of the Tutsis of Rwanda or in using this atlas for educational purpose (e.g. to teach about this genocide). Atlas users can visualize, listen to and explore each individual story in the *Stories* module, but they can also explore how different stories overlap spatially and thematically by using the *Themes* module.

For more details please look at the documentation provided on [the project's GitHub page](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlascine/wiki).

## Content creators

The **content creator** is an advanced user who can modify the content of an existing atlas. For instance, an atlas contributor could add new stories to an existing atlas, add tags to existing stories, add new media and change the legend. 

For more details please look at the documentation provided on [the project's GitHub page](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlascine/wiki).

## Atlas managers

Finally, the **atlas manager** oversees the deployment and maintenance of an Atlascine project. The atlas manager needs to be comfortable with Linux server management through a command line interface, but they can rely on the documentation for deploying and maintaining an Atlascine project.

For more details please look at the documentation provided on [the project's GitHub page](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlascine/wiki).
