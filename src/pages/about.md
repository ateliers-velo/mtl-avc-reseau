The main aim of Atlascine was to streamline the process of transforming audiovisual material into a digital map and to enable a direct interface between audiovisual material, text and the map.

# Aknowledgements

The Atlascine project is led by Sébastien Caquard in close collaboration with Emory Shaw at the Geomedia Lab of Concordia University.

The software development for Atlascine was carried out at the Geomatics and Cartographic Research Center (GCRC) of Carleton University by Jean-Pierre-Fiset, Decheng Zheng, Robert Oikle, and especially Alex Gao, under the supervision of Amos Hayes, Peter Pulsifer, and D.R. Fraser Taylor, using the open-source Nunaliit software. Thanks also to Tanvir Islam, Jazmin Romero, Ryan Taylor, and Andrew Schoenrock from Research Computing Services (Carleton University). This project also benefited from the research work conducted by Sabine Bergler, Nadia Bilal, Nadia Sheikh, Catherine Dominguès, and Rodolphe Gonzalès.
