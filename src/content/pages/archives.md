Hello,
We are B√©cyks Unis de Montr√©al - Bikes Unite Montr√©al. We are a network of community bike shops. We use our acronym BUM BUM externally and in our documentation, internally we are free. We may yell BuM! bUm! Or buuuuuuum or any other spelling or üçëüçë, as we wish, because we are aware that it is a play on words about butts. The following text is our collective agreement.

# What is a community bike shop?

BUM BUM recognizes a community bike shop as a space centered around the ability of community members to (self-)repair their bicycle at minimal cost.It is a place where people come together to share resources, knowledge, and tools related to bicycles. These shops are typically operated by volunteers and focus on promoting cycling, bike maintenance, and community engagement. The primary goal of CBS is to provide an inclusive space where individuals, regardless of their identity or origins, can learn about bicycles, repair and maintain their own bikes, and access affordable or free bike-related services.

# BUM BUM is a network of community bike shops

BUM BUM aims at being accessible. An accessible network of CBS is easy to approach, understand, reach, enter, use, or obtain. It removes barriers or obstacles, making something available to a larger and more diverse audience, and ensuring that everyone, regardless of differences, can equally benefit or participate.

BUM BUM aims to foster resilience. A resilient network of CBS describes the ability of these shops to withstand, recover from, and adapt to challenges, ensuring the sustainability of CBS operations.
